1. the libraries required to run the project including the full version of each library

python==3.7.13
numpy==1.21.6
cv2==3.4.2
sklearn==1.0.2
keras==2.8.0
tensorflow==2.8.0

2. how to run your solution and where to look for the output file.

The solution consists of a .ipynb notebook. The development environment used for writing this solution is colab.
In order to run the code, you need to have in the same path as the .ipynb file the following files:
	template.jpg
	MyBestModel2.zip
	Custom_Data.zip
	test (the test directory containing all images)
	train (the training directory containing all images)
Once the code is run, the final cell will display the final score. The code also outputs the .txt files containing the results in a folder named '/content/gdrive/MyDrive/results/' saved on google drive.
It takes about 1 hour for the solution to run.
